Minyl was my individual capstone project for Flatiron School that allows vinyl collectors to search thousands of albums and add them to their vinyl collection to rate, review, and listen.

Minyl utilized the Deezer API for music data, Semantic UI React / Ant Design for design components, JavaScript / React for Front end and Ruby on Rails for backend.

Below is a YouTube demo walking through the full application:
